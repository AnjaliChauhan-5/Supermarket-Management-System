# Supermarket-Management-System
The Supermarket Management System, developed using C++, is a useful tool that efficiently manages a supermarket. It is created to be user-friendly for both administrators and customers. For administrators, it simplifies tasks such as adding, editing, and removing products, and it maintains an organized database. Security features ensure that only authorized users can access the system. Customers also have a seamless experience. They can easily find products, view prices, and make purchases with transparent totals and any applicable discounts. The system generates detailed receipts for each transaction, making it easy to keep track of purchases.
